                <p class="style191">In solidarity and sympathy with Chinese students and colleagues as they deal with the coronavirus outbreak, COMAP has decided to offer an alternate entrance into MCM/ICM for this year.<br>
                  <br>
                  In an effort to accommodate all students/teams we will be breaking the MCM/ICM competition into 2 contest weekends. Teams may choose from either Weekend 1: February 13-17, 2020 or Weekend 2: March 5-9, 2020. You are NOT required to choose a weekend prior to the contest start. Each weekend will offer a selection of different problems. However, teams may only submit a solution during one weekend and to only one problem. <br>
                  <br>
                  All teams must be registered by the registration deadline of <strong>3:00 p.m. EST on Thursday, February 13, 2020</strong> regardless of the weekend they plan to compete. Teams that have already registered and received a team number/control number <strong>DO NOT</strong> need to re-register.                </p>
                <p class="style191"><strong>Weekend 1 will be February 13-17, 2020 solutions will be due on February 17th</strong><br>
                  <strong>Weekend 1 will include 3 problem options. MCM Problem A, ICM Problem D &amp; ICM Problem E.</strong>                </p>

                  The judging process is unchanged for 2020 and the papers are judged on their merit and given the appropriate ranking. The ratio of the rankings are not predetermined and are based on the quality of the submissions for that given year.

                <p><span class="style191">Because of this yearâ€™s extraordinary circumstances we will not penalize teams for communicating with each other online or through the use web chat apps. We do however want to make it clear that this is for communication among team members only and NOT for communication with other teams or any person outside of the team.  It is the responsibility of the teams to keep their communications private and not post any information in an open or public venue.
                  
                  All current rules will still be in effect and all team members must still be from the same institution. COMAP will continue to monitor these sites before, during and after the contest.

                <p><span class="style191"> I have already registered do I need to register again for Weekend 2?
                    <br>
                    NO, if you have already registered you do not need to register again. You can login and turn in a solution paper during Weekend 1 or you can login and turn in a solution paper during Weekend 2.

                    <br>
                    YES, you can view the problems on Weekend 1 and not submit a solution, and then wait for Weekend 2. If you do chose to wait for Weekend 2, you must choose a problem and submit a solution during Weekend 2. You cannot go back to Weekend 1 after the submission deadline.
                  </span></p>
                <p><span class="style191">Can I submit a solution to both weekends?
                    <br>
                  NO, students are only allowed to participate on 1 team and submit a solution to only 1 weekend. Teams must submit papers by the deadlines associated with their selected problem weekend. </span></p>
                <p><span class="style191">Can I form 2 teams and compete both weekends?

                <p><span class="style191">How do I choose Weekend 1 or Weekend 2?
                    <br>
                    Your choice is dictated by the problem you choose. Weekend 1 includes MCM Problem A, ICM Problem D, &amp; ICM Problem E.  Weekend 2 includes MCM Problem B, MCM Problem C, &amp; ICM Problem F. If a team submits a solution to a problem during Weekend 1,  they cannot submit a solution during Weekend 2.

                <p><span class="style191">Will these changes continue for MCM/ICM 2021 and beyond?
                    <br>
                  NO, this change will only happen this year to help student/teams affected by public health measures to participate.</span></p>
                <p><span class="style191">If my team cannot meet in the same location to work on the contest problem, can we meet using electronic communications?<br>
                  YES, this year you are allowed to work with your team virtually using electronic means. BUT, you may only communicate with members of your own team. The rule remains that teams may not use any persons, other than their own team members, to discuss or obtain ideas for working on and solving their problem. </span><br>
